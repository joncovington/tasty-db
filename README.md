# tasty-db

**Your TastyTrade trading history, on your own machine, with real answers about
performance.**

tasty-db pulls your complete TastyTrade transaction history into a local SQLite
database and turns it into the reports the broker doesn't give you:

- **Realized PnL by lot** — every open matched to its close (FIFO or LIFO) for
  stocks, equity options, futures, and futures options, with fees allocated and
  expirations, assignments, exercises, and cash settlements handled correctly.
- **Strategy & roll-chain views** — spreads entered as one order report as one
  trade, named by their leg shape (Iron condor, Short strangle, Put credit
  spread, ...), and rolled positions are stitched into whole campaigns with
  running credit and total PnL.
- **Account-level returns** — time-weighted return (TWR) and money-weighted
  return (XIRR) computed from daily net-liq snapshots and your actual deposits
  and withdrawals, so you can compare yourself to a benchmark honestly.
- **A local web dashboard** to browse all of it — no cloud, no account linking,
  everything stays on your machine.

Syncing is idempotent and incremental: raw broker transactions are the source
of truth, and all derived tables can be rebuilt from them at any time.

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/exsanguinator/tasty-db
cd tasty-db
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

The `tastydb` command is installed into the venv (`.venv/bin/tastydb`, or just
`tastydb` after activating the venv).

## Setup: API credentials

TastyTrade's API uses OAuth2. One-time setup:

1. Log in at [my.tastytrade.com](https://my.tastytrade.com) and go to
   **Manage → My Profile → API → OAuth Applications**.
2. Create an OAuth application — this gives you a **client secret**.
3. Create a **personal grant** for it — this gives you a long-lived
   **refresh token**.

On Windows (and any OS with a keyring), tasty-db reads both from the system
keyring by default, using the same entry as cherrypick: service
`cherrypick-broker`, entries `production:client_secret` and
`production:refresh_token`. If cherrypick is already set up, there is nothing
more to do. Keyring lookup applies to prod only (not `--sandbox`) and can be
disabled with `TASTYDB_KEYRING=off`.

Otherwise, or to override the keyring, provide both as environment variables:

```sh
export TT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
export TT_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
```

…or in a `.env` file in the working directory (gitignored; real environment
variables take precedence):

```
TT_CLIENT_SECRET=...
TT_REFRESH_TOKEN=...
```

Optional settings: `TT_ENV=sandbox` (or `--sandbox`) to use TastyTrade's cert
environment, `TASTYDB_DB_URL` / `--db` to point at a specific database, and
`TASTYDB_MATCH_METHOD=lifo` to match lots LIFO instead of FIFO. Each
environment gets its own database file by default (`tastydb.sqlite3` for prod,
`tastydb-sandbox.sqlite3` for sandbox), so experimenting never touches real
data. Credentials are never written to the database or the repo.

## Quick start

```sh
tastydb sync --backfill   # one-time: pull full history for all accounts
tastydb process           # build lots and realized closes from the raw data
tastydb dashboard         # open the web dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:8787/
```

Day to day:

```sh
tastydb sync              # incremental pull (safe to run anytime; dedupes)
tastydb process           # rebuild derived tables after a sync
tastydb status            # health check: counts + anything needing attention
```

`sync` also records an end-of-day net-liq snapshot per account, which is what
powers the returns/performance features — so a periodic `sync` (e.g. a nightly
cron job) keeps both your trade history and your performance data current.

## Typical use cases

### "How much did I actually make on my trades?" — realized PnL

Lot-based, fee-inclusive realized PnL from actual fills:

```sh
tastydb realized --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-06-30   # a date window
tastydb realized --underlying SPX                      # one underlying
tastydb realized --group-by close_reason               # trade vs expiry vs assignment...
tastydb realized --group-by strategy                   # iron condors vs strangles vs...
```

Sample output:

```
$ tastydb realized --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-06-30
underlying            closes        qty         fees   realized pnl
------------------------------------------------------------------
SPX                       42      96.00       312.48        8441.25
/ES                       11      14.00        59.22       -1230.00
AAPL                       6     400.00         4.12         962.40
/MES                       9      18.00        31.86         415.50
TLT                        5      25.00         9.85        -212.55
------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                          417.53        8376.60
```

This answers the *trading skill* question: for every position you closed, what
did you make or lose? Expirations, assignments, exercises, and cash-settled
index options are all booked at broker-reported values. In the dashboard, the
**Realized**, **Closes**, **Strategies**, and **Chains** pages give the same
numbers with charts, filters, and drill-down to individual lots.

### "How much premium have I collected?" — credits

A simple cash-flow view: every sell (to open or to close) is a credit, every
buy (to open or to close) is a debit, summed over a date range and broken
down by underlying. Unlike `realized`, this isn't lot-matched — it's raw cash in
vs. cash out from trading, including cash-settled index option expirations
(e.g. SPX, XSP) and futures' daily mark-to-market settlements. (A futures
trade itself only carries the cash since the previous day's settlement, so
without the daily marks a futures position's credits would be meaningless;
with them, a closed futures position's credits equal its realized PnL before
fees.)

```sh
tastydb credits --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-06-30   # a date window
tastydb credits --underlying SPX                      # one underlying
tastydb credits --group-by strategy                   # by structure, not symbol
```

Sample output:

```
$ tastydb credits --start 2026-01-01 --end 2026-06-30
underlying            trades        credits
-------------------------------------------
SPX                      184       38550.00
AAPL                      12        1620.00
/ES                        6        -840.00
-------------------------------------------
TOTAL                                39330.00
```

The dashboard's **Credits** page shows the same total and per-underlying
breakdown, plus a cumulative credits chart, with the usual account/date-range
filters. Switch it to *By strategy* and click a name to see the individual
trades behind that strategy's credits.

### "How is my account actually performing?" — net-liq returns

Realized trade PnL deliberately excludes dividends, interest, fees on cash,
and unrealized moves. For whole-account performance, use `tastydb pnl`,
which works from daily net-liq and your external cash flows instead:

```sh
tastydb pnl --start 2026-01-01                         # TWR + XIRR per account
```

Sample output:

```
$ tastydb pnl --start 2026-01-01
account            from         to     start NLV       end NLV    net flows          PnL        TWR   TWR ann.      XIRR
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Roth IRA     2026-01-02 2026-07-10      84210.55      92873.10      7000.00      1662.55      1.98%      4.03%      3.87%
Taxable      2026-01-02 2026-07-10     152340.20     148990.75    -10000.00      6650.55      4.42%      9.12%      8.95%
COMBINED     2026-01-02 2026-07-10     236550.75     241863.85     -3000.00      8313.10      3.55%      7.28%      7.02%
```

- **Period $PnL** = ending net-liq − starting net-liq − net deposits/withdrawals.
- **TWR** (time-weighted return) removes the effect of your deposit/withdrawal
  timing — this is the number to compare against SPY.
- **XIRR** (money-weighted return) is the annualized return on *your* dollars,
  timing included.

Deposits, withdrawals, journals, and tax withholding are classified from the
raw Money Movement history; transfers between your own accounts cancel out in
the combined view. The dashboard's **Overview** page shows the net-liq
chart, a flow-neutral growth-of-$100 chart, and the full cash-flow table.

### Comparing the two

If your realized PnL is great but your TWR is flat, the difference is living
somewhere — open positions moving against you, cash drag, or costs outside
trade fills. Running both views over the same window is the fastest way to see
where.

## The web dashboard

`tastydb dashboard` serves a read-only local web UI over the same database:

| Page | What it shows |
|---|---|
| **Overview** | Account performance: net-liq chart, growth-of-$100, TWR/XIRR, cash-flow table |
| **Credits** | Credits collected (sells minus buys): total, cumulative credits chart, per-underlying or per-strategy breakdown |
| **Realized** | Realized PnL / fees, cumulative PnL chart, per-underlying breakdown (all underlyings, by realized PnL), toggleable to a per-strategy one |
| **Positions** | Open lots with cost basis and unrealized PnL from cached marks |
| **Closes** | Every realized close, filterable, linked to its lot |
| **Strategies** | Multi-leg orders reported as single trades, each named by its leg shape (Iron condor, Short strangle, Superbull, ...) |
| **Chains** | Roll campaigns: every roll of a position as one story with total PnL, each step named by the structure it opened |
| **Strategy** | One strategy name drilled down: its trades, its underlyings, and the individual credit-bearing transactions. Reached by clicking a row in the Realized or Credits *By strategy* table, or a name on the Strategies page |

Every view filters by account and date range. The only network call the
dashboard ever makes is the optional *Refresh marks* button (live quotes for
unrealized PnL) — everything else is served from your local database, with
charting vendored (no CDN).

A note on dates: charts and date filters (here and in `tastydb pnl` /
`tastydb credits --start/--end`) use the UTC calendar date of each trade.
Stocks and equity options always land on the same day as on your broker
statement. A few trades don't: futures options traded in the evening session
(~6–7pm ET, which CME counts as the next trading day) or on exchange holidays,
and crypto traded in the evening ET. Those can appear one day off from the
broker's trade date. Totals over a date range only differ when a range starts
or ends on one of those days. The **Overview** page uses the broker's trade
dates.

### Web Dashboard Sample (Realized page)

### Viewing the dashboard from another device

The dashboard binds to `127.0.0.1`, so by default only the machine running it
can open it. To reach it from a phone or another computer on your network,
run `forward.py` from the repo root next to the dashboard. It's a tiny
standard-library TCP relay that listens on all interfaces on port 8787 and
passes each connection through to `127.0.0.1:8787`:

```sh
tastydb dashboard      # terminal 1
python3 forward.py     # terminal 2 (Ctrl-C to stop)
```

Then browse to `http://<this-machine's-LAN-IP>:8787/`.

- Both sides use port 8787. That works on macOS because loopback traffic goes
  to the more specific `127.0.0.1` binding, but on Linux the relay usually
  fails with "Address already in use". If it does, set `LISTEN_PORT` in
  `forward.py` to another port (e.g. 8788) and browse to that one.
- You can skip the relay with `tastydb dashboard --host 0.0.0.0`, which
  serves the dashboard on every interface directly.
- The dashboard has no authentication, and anyone who can reach it can press
  *Refresh marks*, which calls the TastyTrade API with your credentials. Only
  expose it on a network you trust.

## How it works (in one paragraph)

Three stages: **ingest** stores every raw broker transaction verbatim, keyed
by transaction id (idempotent, updated in place if the broker reconciles fees
overnight); **classify** turns raw rows into typed position events, flagging
anything unrecognized as `unsupported` rather than silently dropping it (see
`tastydb status`); **match** replays those events in order into lots and
closes. `tastydb process` rebuilds the derived tables from scratch every run —
raw data is the source of truth, so a rule fix or re-sync is never a
migration, just a reprocess. Lot ids are the opening broker transaction ids,
so they stay stable across rebuilds.

Known limits: stock splits, symbol changes, mergers, and ACAT transfers are
flagged rather than modeled, and realized PnL intentionally excludes
dividends/interest (those show up in the account-level returns view instead).

## Development

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -q   # fast, fully offline test suite
```

Tests never hit the network — they replay synthetic payloads shaped like real
API responses. See `CLAUDE.md` for architecture notes and invariants, and
`PLAN.md` for the roadmap.
