"""Account-level returns from NLV snapshots + external cash flows.

Two standard measures over any window covered by balance_snapshots:

- TWR (time-weighted): daily-chained with the end-of-day flow convention —
  for consecutive snapshot dates d_prev < d with values V_prev, V and external
  flows F dated in (d_prev, d], the link is r = (V - F) / V_prev - 1, and the
  window return chains (1+r) across links. Flow timing is neutralized, which
  makes TWR the number to compare against a benchmark.
- XIRR (money-weighted): the annualized rate x solving NPV = 0 over the
  investor's dated cash flows: -V_start at the window open, -deposit /
  +withdrawal for each external flow, +V_end at the close. Answers "what did
  my dollars earn" including flow timing.

Dollar PnL over the window is the model-free identity
V_end - V_start - net external flows.

Conventions: the window base is the first snapshot >= start (its NLV already
contains that day's flows — EOD convention), the window close is the last
snapshot <= end. Exception: when the base NLV is not positive (account not yet
funded), flows dated on the base day count inside the window -- the broker takes
the EOD snapshot before a same-day deposit posts, so a $0 base never contains it.
Links where the base NLV is not positive are skipped (a deposit-funded restart
from zero has no defined return). Rates are ratios,
not money — reported to 6 decimal places, never forced to money quantization.
